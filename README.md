## Context
During Learn Mode, users will be shown each question in a given Bundle one-by-one. For each question, the user must give a response - which will be graded correct or incorrect. A given study session in learn mode is considered complete when a student has answered each question correctly at least twice. The first question that the user sees is selected at random from the Bundle. After their response to this question, every subsequent question is selected from the Bundle by the *Learn Mode algorithm.*
